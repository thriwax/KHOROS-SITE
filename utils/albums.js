        review: `The debut release from Fryazino-based sound artist klad mineralov is a collection of sonic vignettes, carefully crafted memorabilia of deeply personal states and experiences. Six soundscapes with a gentle and twiggy structure turn toward the natural world in the form of an aural herbarium: short and brittle snapshots of the moments in-between non-existence and eternity.
        <br><br>
        The key inspiration for klad mineralov's music is the haunted post-Soviet landscape of Fryazino, a town in the rabbit hole of Moscow suburbs with a surreal clash of industrial melancholia surrounded by forest and wild nature. Moscow's raw suburban psychedelia distorted his sound, drawing out new approaches in his low-end breakbeat project ‘Хулиганская электроника’ (hooligan electronics) and bolstering the gentle drone trajectory of his side-project klad mineralov.
        <br><br>
        Hazy layers of alien field recordings, contact mic miasma, off-kilter PureData algorithms, and extended vocal techniques blur the lines in the immersive sonic meditations of "Inner Herbarium". Greetings and best wishes to anyone who dives deep into the hypnotic sound world of Fryazino's maverick klad mineralov.
